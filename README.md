# Book-recommendation-system-for-Gutenberg-library
"The book recommendation system for Gutenburg library" is a project for extreme level readers who has reached to a point that it is no longer quick and easy for an user to look through the book catalog of Gutenburg Library but still want to read the public domain books that are readily available in Gutenburg.
## Introduction
This project is created as a Uni project by [Sadman Ishtiak](https://github.com/Sadman-Ishtiak) and [Jahid Hasan Khan Ornob](https://github.com/ornobkhan20). The target of the project is to get book choice when the user has read a substantioal number of books from [Gutenburg Library](https://gutenberg.org/). And the user wants to read more from the library but doesn't want to go through the book catalog as the user can only get the catalog as the most downloaded list. But that list consists of books that most bookworms have already read and it is truly a shame that from over 50,000 books in different formats with over 78,000 versions and we can only get like 50-ish books that most readers have already read. So if you already have read a lot of books and want to read more from these public domain books or if you are interested in these classics and want to read more books of the simmilar era. You can easily get help from this project to get some choice of books that you probably never heard before.
